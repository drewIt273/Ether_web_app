# Ether Web App

Ether is a productivity web app inspired by the best of Notion and Linear. The goal is to provide users with powerful tools for task and project management, note-taking, and eventually more—all in one seamless experience.

> **Note:**  
> This project is in its early stages of development!

## Project Vision

Unlike Notion and Linear, **Ether is desktop-first**. The first versions will focus on letting users save their projects, files, and notes directly on their own device.  
Future updates may include features like syncing across devices, cloud backups, and server-side storage.

This project is also a learning journey—to help me level up my skills in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and (eventually) Electron** by building a solid, real-world app from scratch.

## Features (Planned)

- **Task & Project Management:**  
  Organize your work with boards, lists, and timelines—just like Notion and Linear.

- **Notes:**  
  Take, edit, and organize notes easily.

- **Flexible Local Storage:**  
  Projects and notes are saved on your device (future: sync & backup options).

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript** (vanilla)
- **JSON** (planned for storage)
- **Electron** (planned, for desktop app capabilities)
